                        OKO is a manufacturing company and we concentrate on giving Distributors the best possible price. Local advertising and promotion is the responsibility of each Distributor in their country. Support is available from OKO’s Marketing Department in the form
                        of wording, artwork and printed literature. OKO also advertises on Google AdWords in all countries in which it has active distributors, and works continuously to optimise the leading positions of this website in search engines.

                        It is extremely important to OKO that our Distribution network offers a top-quality and consistent level of service. Therefore an OKO manager visits each new Distributor to train their team on each aspect of how the product works, how to demonstrate,
                        present, price, place and promote it, and how to support the customers.

                        normal tyre types, PowerPoint presentations, photographs, a link to our website, reports of testing, safety data sheets, and of course packaging in various languages. You also get telephone and email support with any issues, queries

                        If you are selected to be an OKO Distributor, you will need to pay upfront for at least your first few orders until you establish a credit record with us. You will need to satisfy us that you can order stock that will be sufficient to service your country’s
                        customers without any break in supply. But above all, we expect your commitment to the OKO brand and to making it the number 1 tyre sealant in your region, sector or country.

                    <h4>How long has OKO Group manufactured an OKO Tyre sealant?</h4>
                    <div style="display: none;">
                        OKO have been tyre sealant suppliers for over 38 years.

                    <h4>Can I use OKO in a TPMS-equipped vehicle?</h4>
                    <div style="display: none;">
                        Tyre sealant runs around the inside of the tyre tread. Thus in most instances it should not come into contact with an internal TPMS (Tyre Pressure Monitoring System) valve sensor when in use. However, when fitting OKO you may cause the sensor to be coated
                        and thus affect its performance: in this case you may need to remove and clean the sensor. OKO recommends that you consult your vehicle manufacturer to check whether their internal TPMS system is sealant-friendly before fitting
                        anti-puncture sealant – and external TPMS systems that measure the tyre from outside are of course always OKO-compatible.

                    <h4>Does the use of OKO Tyre Sealant make a Tyre warranty void?</h4>
                    <div style="display: none;">
                        There is no legal reason under EU or USA law that should allow a Tyre manufacturer to say that their warranties are void due to the use of OKO Tyre Sealant, whether Off Road or On Road OKO. We hold copies of statements from major commercial tyre manufacturers
                        stating that the fitting of tyre sealant does not void their warranties. Since the inception of OKO, there has been no report that OKO has caused a new tyre warranty rejection or a retread casing rejection. All OKO formulations
                        are harmless to tyres and rubber and are compatible with rubber tyre components. It is possible that on rare occasions a retail tyre distributor may take a negative stance against OKO. This is likely to be due to a historic and
                        cultural tradition of being “anti-sealant” or ignorance of the modern technological information provided by The OKO Group.
                    </div>

                <section>
                    <h4>Does OKO extend effective tyre life by helping to maintain correct air pressures?</h4>
                    <div>
                        By using OKO, it is possible to combat porosity which is a natural process of air migration through the tyre casing. By eliminating the possibility of driving on under­inflated tyres, it is likely that tyres will remain in effective service for longer
                        periods. OKO will also tend to cool the tyre, and retard dry rot and casing degradation. These effects help to lengthen the life of the tubeless tyre casing. In a 5-month test in matched MAN trucks, an OKO fitted tractor unit had
                        20% less tyre wear than a non-OKO tractor across all tyres. In another test with temperature-monitored tyres on a heavy-duty forestry truck, the OKO-equipped tyres were on average 11.5% cooler than the matching non-OKO tyres.

                <section>
                    <h4>Will using OKO prevent the retreading of the tyres?</h4>
                    <div>
                        No. OKO Puncture Free is compatible with retreading methods, both cold and hot cures. OKO does not have adverse effects on tyre casings or metal tyre cords. It is recommended that tyre casings are cleaned and dried prior to collection by the Retreading
                        company or before delivery to them. OKO is retread-friendly, easy to clean with water and does not mask the punctures and holes sealed. It should be simple for “NDT” machines to find all the punctures sealed by OKO. OKO sealants
                        have been formulated to be compatible with compounds used within a tyre. The R &amp; D of OKO has been carried out in collaboration with “TARRC”, a leading Tyre &amp; Rubber Research Institution (formerly M.R.P.R.A., a research
                        institution owned jointly by The Malaysian &amp; British Governments). OKO does not pose any hazards or flammability issues for the Retreading companies either.

                    <h4>Are OKO-fitted tyres likely to replace 'run flat' tyres?</h4>
                    <div>
                        Unlikely. The widest choice should be available to consumers. As long as truthful and full knowledge is freely available, the consumer can make a proper choice. “Run Flat” tyres are supplied by Tyre Manufacturers and may be considered useful for specific
                        users who are willing to pay more for that particular tyre knowing it may only function correctly once.
                        <p></p>
                        <p>OKO provides a permanent seal product that has a capability of sealing many holes on different occasions.

                    <h4>Are there any special maintenance requirements for tyres fitted with OKO?</h4>
                    <div>
                        No. As with any other tyres, drivers should check them regularly for cuts, penetration damage, and a loss of air pressure. Checks should be made at least twice a month, whether it is an Off Road tyre or any type of On Road tyre.

                        No. Tyres with OKO can be disposed of via conventional recycling. OKO Group can recommend the methods required if there is a significant amount of OKO to disperse.

                        The OKO Group makes several different formulations. These are designed and engineered especially for certain vehicle types. Any user of OKO will be able to choose using this site; or by examining the clear description on the labels of the different size
                        bottles and drums.

                    <h4>Can OKO be used in tyres with inner tubes as well as tubeless tyres?</h4>
                    <div>
                        Yes. OKO will seal holes in the outer casing and in the inner tubes as well. In certain situations, there are reservations.&nbsp;Inner tubes are problematical. They can be unreliable and the wall thickness inconsistent. The inner tube can move inside
                        the tyre. Inner tubes tend to rip when a puncturing object remains.
                        <p></p>
                        <p>OKO will function and seal holes without or with inner tubes: but if the wheels and tyres permit it, the best combination for most Off &amp; On Road users is to use a Tubeless tyre with OKO applied. This is the less expensive and
                            better performing option for puncture free driving. One major reservation: if On Road OKO RTG is to be applied to the tyres of a Heavy truck, then apply it to tubeless tyres only.

                        Not especially, but common sense needs to be used. Avoid contact with the eyes; avoid prolonged skin contact with the sticky viscous layer inside the tyre; and do not drink the product. OKO can be removed from the skin with soaps and industrial hand cleaners.
                        If OKO gets in the eyes, wash with copious amounts of clean water.

                    <div>
                        When a tyre is deflated on purpose for any reason (by an individual), it is virtually guaranteed that the vehicle is standing still. When the tyre is motionless the OKO remains in place, coating the inside tread area of the tyre. It does not travel towards
                        the valve stem. Insufficient air pressure and the lack of movement is enough to ensure the OKO remains in its correct place.

                    <div>
                        No. When applying the OKO product, some residue may remain inside the valve stem. This residue should be cleared by using an air-line as per the instructions. OKO tyre sealant coats the inside of the tyre. It will not travel back up the valve stem. Normally,
                        conditions inside the tyre mean that no air is forced back through the valve stem out to the outside environment.

                        If OKO splashes on clothes, it should be wiped off immediately, preferably with a wet cloth. If some OKO residue remains, wash the clothing that evening or during the same day. Avoid leaving the clothes for a long time with the OKO in a dry state. Contact
                        with clothing should be avoided where possible.

                        Tyres filled with water. Some rear Tractor tyres are ballasted by farmers to weigh down the vehicle. Or some pack rear tyres with weights or sand. Part-ballasting the tyre with OKO and using axle weights as needed is preferable (for the vehicle and the
                        land) to using water or sand inside tyres. At least the puncture problem would be eliminated too. (OKO cannot function inside a tyre that has been filled with water).

Both OKO OFF Road and On Road grades have been used in vehicles in hot Desert conditions and in the northern Russian winter.<br>                        OKO RTG was tested in fast moving truck tyres over a 500 mile course starting at 6,000 feet above sea level and driving down to sea level. The trucks repeated the journey until 110,000 Km (68,750 miles) had been driven. Punctures
                        suffered early during this test remained sealed throughout. The holes remained blocked by the permanent OKO seal. After 110,000 km, the product remained effective, sealing further punctures. OKO RTG remained inside the tyre in
                        liquid form, positioned as designed, effectively coating and protecting the inner tread area of the tyres. &nbsp;The inclusion of a special ingredient within the formulation kept the tyres cooler than normal.

                    <h4>Does OKO cause wheel imbalance?</h4>
                    <div>
                        OKO will not cause wheel imbalance if the product is dosed correctly. Any temptation to apply more than the recommended dose must be strictly resisted. When applying On Road OKO to a Motorcycle or Car, the instructions should be strictly adhered to. Only
                        the recommended quantity should be inserted. Having applied the OKO, these vehicles should be driven carefully and slowly for a distance of 10 to 16 km. – (approx. 6 to 10 miles).
                        <p></p>
                        <p>During this initial “run in” distance, OKO will line the inner tread area of the tyre. Once this inner coat has been formed, there should be no wheel imbalance. Any minor quantity acting as a reservoir by swirling around the tyre
                            is not sufficient to cause wheel vibration. It is recommended that wheels of vehicles of 5 tonnes or lower are balanced prior to fitting OKO. In some cases, where initial wheel vibration is experienced at certain speeds, the
                            vehicle must be driven slowly until vibration disappears. OKO Off Road should NOT be fitted to fast moving On Road vehicles or driven at a speed regularly exceeding 80 km/h (50 mph).<br> [/vc_accordion_tabR

                            <div></div>
                        </section>
                        <p>Generally, once the OKO has coated the inner tyre, the majority of the OKO will remain as a coating. If the “On Road vehicle” has been idle for a long period some minor wheel vibration may be detected when first starting off. This
                            will disappear rapidly if the vehicle is driven steadily. This issue is NOT relevant to the use of Off Road OKO; OKO puncture sealants for Bikes; or On Road RTG OKO for Heavy Trucks or Buses.

                    <div>
                        This is likely to be an extremely rare event. Due to the strength of the OKO seal, in normal conditions, it is unlikely that a conventional vulcanised repair is required. If necessary, OKO can be removed from the inside of the tyre by washing it out.
                        The best method is by using a hose. The tyre can be dried. Then, a vulcanised repair can be applied, if necessary.

                        Not at all. OKO is designed in normal use to last the legal life of a tyre. In high-mileage on-road truck tyres it normally lasts for 62,000 miles + / 100,000 km + and the dosage may then need to be topped up: it depends on the conditions, whether new
                        or remould tyres are used and how the vehicle is driven.

                        According to UK Forensic studies, a nail can penetrate a tyre and on average will remain there for between 60 and 180 miles (96 to 290 km). The nail is likely to eject itself after this period. If OKO is inside the tyre, the vehicle is motionless, and
                        the nail is noticed to be in the tread area:<br> i. The driver should pull the nail;AND,ii. Drive immediately; this will cause OKO to make a new seal. If the nail is unnoticed and ejects itself, as the vehicle
                        is in motion, OKO will make a new seal.

                        Tyre structures are likely to be weakened by sidewall and “Run Flat” damage. Using OKO will eliminate many if not all of the risks associated with “Run Flat damage” but OKO will not seal sidewall holes.

                        OKO Group regards the seal to be a permanent seal due to its strength. When subjected to a “strength test” at the Gerotek Test Facility, OKO was compared to a “Repair plug” and a “vulcanised repair”. In this case, it was shown that the OKO permanent seal
                        was 1.6 times stronger than a vulcanised repair and 7 times stronger than a “repair plug”. (The tyre industry states that a “Traditional repair” – defined as a vulcanised repair – is permanent. Therefore, the seal made by OKO On
                        Road &amp; Off Road, that is so much stronger, should be regarded by users and consumers as “more permanent still”).

                        off when a tyre is changed. It is advisable NOT to use any tyre sealant with chrome-plated wheels as they are susceptible to chemical effects. (Check with your supplier: polished alloys may look like chrome, and they are OKO-compatible).<br>                        OKO uses inhibitors unique in the tyre sealant industry. These inhibitors are entirely friendly to the environment.
